#Pathfinder App
##(name to be decided)

This is an app we are making for our third year project in the Bachelor of Information Technology at Southern Institute of Technology, New Zealand.
The group working on this is called "Real Standard Studios"
We aim to have a working replacement for all paper and books used by the average player in the [pathfinder RPG](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/) by the end of 2014

The app will:

 - Link players with each other using bluetooth or similar wireless technology.
 - Gms can generate mobs for combats and other misc npcs.
 - Gms can create battlemaps for combats.
 - Players can join in on the battlemap with the generated mobs for combat using a token or small sprite.
 - Dice rolls are sent to the GM to remove the ability to fudge dice rolls.
 - Small chat system to allow players to message each other, notifications to the GM that X player and Y player are whispering to each other and the ability to watch the conversation.
 - Let players message the GM to allow for actions to be kept secret from the party.
 - Let Game masters schedule games and have these games pushed to users google calendars.


Targeting Android version 4.0.3 (API version 15) and higher, this allows us to use more modern features and reach 78.6 of all android users.

A UI that works for phone screens as well as tablets will be required to target all of these devices.
